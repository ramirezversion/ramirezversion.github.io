### lab description

The lab is called technically [Attacking and Defending Active Directory](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/activedirectorylab) and is hosted by [Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com). The lab and de exam was designed by [Nikhil Mittal](https://twitter.com/nikhil_mitt) creator of some tools like [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) and [Kautilya](https://github.com/samratashok/Kautilya) among others. Do you know them? xD

The course is all about performing Red Teaming assessment with assume breach mentality and completing the objectives which are like exercise after each topic.

Basically you will start from a student workstation with low privileges and a user into the AD and using only tools, features and PowerShell you have to build appropriate attack vectors to compromise a whole realistic AD environment.

You will also learn about countermeasures and remediation techniques for most of the topics covered in the lab which will increase the quality of your reports.

The network lab is very similar that are showed into its web site.
